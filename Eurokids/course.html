    <h1>Our facilities</h1>
    <p>A pre-school is for children between the ages of three and five years, staffed by qualified teachers and other professionals who encourage and supervise educational play rather than simply providing childcare. 
       It is a pre-primary institution, part of early childhood education. The curriculum goals of a pre-school are more specific than for childcare, but less strenuous than for primary school. 
       The preschool is the first step children take into the outside world therefore great care has been taken to plan the facilities at the pre school.</p>

            <h3>Classrooms</h3>
            <p>The rooms are bright, safe and child friendly with low level molded furniture and safe materials. 
                The hub of the class room is the different learning corners that focus on individual learners and their strengths</p>

            <p>For us, hygiene and the safety of children matters a lot. It has resulted in us taking complete care in maintaining hygiene in our Pre-School and being pro safety.
                We've introduced and implemented safety and hygiene measures in all our Pre-Schools.</p>
